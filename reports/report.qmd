# Problem Background


```{python}
from helpers import create_database_engine, run_sql_and_return_df, run_sql_and_return_html, create_db_wrapper, execute_ddl_from_file, execute_ddl

# Load these variables from .env file.
config_map = {
  'user': "CMSC408_HW8_USER",
  'password': "CMSC408_HW8_PASSWORD",
  'host': "CMSC408_HW8_HOST",
  'database': "CMSC408_HW8_DB_NAME"
}

cnx,config = create_db_wrapper( config_map )
  
```


```{python}
# Do a quick test of the connection and trap the errors better!

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  table_schema, table_name, table_rows
from
  information_schema.tables
where
  table_schema in ('world_bank_data')
""")

```

# Exercises

In the following exercises, write the SQL as requested to discover the answer.

## Task 1

How many records are in the country table?

```{python}
# How many records are in the world_bank_data.wdi_country table?
# (skills: select, aggregate)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  count(*) as "Row Count"
from
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
""")

```

## Task 2

Explore the first 5 records in the country table.

```{python}
## write out the first 10 records and look at the columns
## Do you see any blanks or missing data?
## (skills: select, limit)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  *
from 
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
limit 5
""")

```


## Task 3

List all non-countries.

```{python}
## task 3
## Which records are NOT for countries, that is they're for regions or groups of countries.
## How can you tell?
## Once you figure it out, write a query to list all the non-countries
## (skills: select, where)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select "doh!" as "Homer says ..." from dual
""")
```

## Task 4

Create your own copy of WDI_Country containing just countries.

```{python}
## task 4
## The WDI table clearly contains information for countries and non-countries
## using CREATE TABLE ... SELECT from WHERE syntax.
## Finally, below write a query to return the number
## of records in the new table.
## (skills: select, aggregate)

# drop table
execute_ddl(cnx,"""
drop table if exists wdi_country;
""")
```

```{python}
# create table
execute_ddl(cnx,"""
""")
```

```{python}
# show number of records
run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select "doh!" as "Homer says ..." from dual
""")
```

## Task 5

According to the World Bank, in 2020 there were how many countries in the world?

```{python}
## (skills: select, aggregate)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select "doh!" as "Homer says ..." from dual
""")

```

## Task 6

What are all unique values of region in the wdi_country table?

```{python}
## Let's investigate the country_region field.
## What is the domain of the country_region field? That is,
## what are the unique values found there?
## (there are several possible ways to code this in SQL)
## (skills: select, aggregate, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select "doh!" as "Homer says ..." from dual
""")

```

## Task 7

How many countries are in each region?

```{python}
## How many countries are in each region?
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select "doh!" as "Homer says ..." from dual
""")

```

## Task 8

List the country full names and regions for all countries in north america.

```{python}
## List the country full names and regions for all countries in north america
## (skills: select, where, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select "doh!" as "Homer says ..." from dual
""")

```

## Task 9

```{python}
## The last World Cup soccer tournament was hosted by Qatar.
## What region contains Qatar?  List the region, country short name and full name
## (skills: select, where)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select "doh!" as "Homer says ..." from dual
""")

```

## Task 10

```{python}
## There are two abbreviation fields in the data country_abbr and country_wb_abbr.
## List the country code, short name, abbr, wb_abbr and region for all the countries
## where the abbr and wb_abbr are different.
## (skills: select, where, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select "doh!" as "Homer says ..." from dual
""")

```

## Task 11

```{python}
## Now, let's investigate the "income category" field.
## List the income categories and the number of countries in each
## income category in descending order of most countries to least.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select "doh!" as "Homer says ..." from dual
""")

```

## Task 12

```{python}
## Mystery task.  Looking at the table from Task 11 (anything odd?) write the
## next obvious query based on the results in the table.
## At a minimum, your query should put country short name in the first column.
## you will be scored on the number of records returned and the value(s) 
## in the first column.

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select "doh!" as "Homer says ..." from dual
""")

```

## Task 13

```{python}
## OK, this HAS to be an error. Let's make a assumption that the country 
## in question, because they are oil-rich, are "high income".  
## Write an update comment to correct the issue.
## NOTE - if you get this wrong, all subsequent tables will be wrong!

execute_ddl(cnx,"""
""")


```
```{python}
## Now, display the country again to verify the change stuck!

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select "doh!" as "Homer says ..." from dual
""")

```

## Task 14

```{python}
## Write a single query that show the number of countries in each 
## "Region"-"Income Group" pair.  The table should have 3 columns:
## region, income group, and no.of.countries.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select "doh!" as "Homer says ..." from dual
""")

```

## Task 15

```{python}
## Examine the result from task 14. It would be really cool to
## present the results of this table in a 2-D form, with 
## columns for each income category (high, upper middle, lower middle, low, other)
## regions down the side, and the pair-wise count inside each cell.
## Using CASE statements, DO IT!  BE SURE to include the countries without
## an income category.

## HINT - your query should return 6 columns: the region name, one
## column for each of the income categories (e.g., High, Upper middle, etc.)
## and a column for the row totals.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, nested query)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select "doh!" as "Homer says ..." from dual
""")

```

## Task 16

```{python}
## Wow! what a cool table!  It is very interesting to see where the money
## sits around the world.  Using the general approach from Task 14 above
## and write a query to return the single region with the most lower-income
## countries.

## Your query should return 3 columns, the number of 
## low-income countries, the region name and the income group

## PUT THE NUMBER FIRST! (use: count, region name, income group)
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, nested query, order by, limit)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select "doh!" as "Homer says ..." from dual
""")

```

## Task 17

```{python}
## Are you getting the hand of this? Good! We need to take a look at all
## the countries in the same region and with the same income category as
## the Marshall Islands.
## For each country that matches, print their country code, short name,
## region and income category, by order of their short name.  As a hint,
## the country code for the Marshall Islands is MHL.
## (skills: select, where, subquery)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select "doh!" as "Homer says ..." from dual
""")

```

## Task 18

```{python}
## OK - let's raise the heat in the kitchen! Review the output from task 14.
## You'll see that some of the regions do not contain all of the income
## levels.  For example, the Europe & Central Asia region does not have
## any low income countries.
##
## CHALLENGE - using a SINGLE SQL statement, write a table that contains every
## combination of region and income category (including the missing '') values!
##
## THEN add a WHERE clause to only show the values that were missing from
## the original pairings!
##
## HINT - there should be AT MOST [# of regions]x[# of income cats] = 28
## rows in your final table, and there are 22 rows returned in the query
## in Task 14.  (FYI - I get 6 rows in my final table.)
## (skills: select, where, subqueries, joins)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select "doh!" as "Homer says ..." from dual
""")

```

## Task 19

```{python}
## Hot enough, yet?  Let's go for ghost-pepper HOT!  Now let's build some
## percentage tables.  For example, across the entire sample, what
## is the percentage of total countries in each income category?
##
## As a first step, build off the result from task 14 and create a table with
## six columns (region, income cat, country count, sum of countries in region,
## sum of countries by income and total sum countries).
##
## THEN, add a 7th column calculating the percent of total for each,
## region-income pair.
##
## actually calculating percentages and print out a table will be a
## slam dunk after this!
## (skills: select, where, subqueries, joins, aggregate functions)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select "doh!" as "Homer says ..." from dual
""")


```

## Task 20

```{python}
## SLAM DUNK TIME!  Using the resulting table CTEs from Task 19,
## print table similar to the table in Task 15, with Income group in the
## columns, Region in the rows and Percent of total in each cell of the table.

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select "doh!" as "Homer says ..." from dual
""")

```

## Task 21

```{python}
## ANOTHER DUNK!  Using the resulting table CTEs from Task 19,
## print a table listing the number, totals and percentage of countries
## by income category.

## (This is much simpler than task 20!)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select "doh!" as "Homer says ..." from dual
""")

```
