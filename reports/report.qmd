# Problem Background


```{python}
from helpers import create_database_engine, run_sql_and_return_df, run_sql_and_return_html, create_db_wrapper, execute_ddl_from_file, execute_ddl

# Load these variables from .env file.
config_map = {
  'user': "CMSC408_HW8_USER",
  'password': "CMSC408_HW8_PASSWORD",
  'host': "CMSC408_HW8_HOST",
  'database': "CMSC408_HW8_DB_NAME"
}

cnx,config = create_db_wrapper( config_map )
  
```


```{python}
# Do a quick test of the connection and trap the errors better!

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  table_schema, table_name, table_rows
from
  information_schema.tables
where
  table_schema in ('world_bank_data')
""")

```

# Exercises

In the following exercises, write the SQL as requested to discover the answer.

## Task 1

How many records are in the country table?

```{python}
# How many records are in the world_bank_data.wdi_country table?
# (skills: select, aggregate)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  count(*) as "Row Count"
from
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
""")

```

## Task 2

Explore the first 5 records in the country table.

```{python}
## write out the first 10 records and look at the columns
## Do you see any blanks or missing data?
## (skills: select, limit)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  *
from 
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
limit 5
""")

```


## Task 3

List all non-countries.

```{python}
## task 3
## Which records are NOT for countries, that is they're for regions or groups of countries.
## How can you tell?
## Once you figure it out, write a query to list all the non-countries
## (skills: select, where)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  `Short Name`
from
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
where
  (`Region` is null
   or (`Income Group` is null and `Short Name` <> 'Venezuela')
   or `Short Name` = 'World')
order by
  `Short Name`
""")

```

## Task 4

Create your own copy of WDI_Country containing just countries.

```{python}
## task 4
## The WDI table clearly contains information for countries and non-countries
## using CREATE TABLE ... SELECT from WHERE syntax.
## Finally, below write a query to return the number
## of records in the new table.
## (skills: select, aggregate)

# drop table
execute_ddl(cnx,"""
drop table if exists wdi_country;

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select 
  count(*) as "Number of Countries in 2020"
from 
  wdi_country
""")

```

## Task 6

What are all unique values of region in the wdi_country table?

```{python}
## Let's investigate the country_region field.
## What is the domain of the country_region field? That is,
## what are the unique values found there?
## (there are several possible ways to code this in SQL)
## (skills: select, aggregate, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select 
  region as "Region",
  count(*) as "Number of Countries"

## Task 8

List the country full names and regions for all countries in north america.

```{python}
## List the country full names and regions for all countries in north america

```

## Task 10

```{python}
## There are two abbreviation fields in the data country_abbr and country_wb_abbr.
## List the country code, short name, abbr, wb_abbr and region for all the countries
## where the abbr and wb_abbr are different.
## (skills: select, where, order by)

## List the income categories and the number of countries in each
## income category in descending order of most countries to least.

## Task 12

```{python}
## Mystery task.  Looking at the table from Task 11 (anything odd?) write the
## next obvious query based on the results in the table.

## Task 13

```{python}
## OK, this HAS to be an error. Let's make a assumption that the country

## Write an update comment to correct the issue.

## Task 14

## Using CASE statements, DO IT!  BE SURE to include the countries without
## an income category.

## HINT - your query should return 6 columns: the region name, one
## column for each of the income categories (e.g., High, Upper middle, etc.)

## Task 18

## the original pairings!

# Reflection

1. Reflect on the SQL skills you used throughout these exercises. Which skills do you feel most confident in, and which do you think need more practice? How has this assignment helped you build or reinforce specific SQL competencies?

I feel most confident in basic SQL skills like SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY clauses. These fundamentals were straightforward to apply in the earlier tasks. I also became more comfortable with aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM) and GROUP BY statements as I worked through the exercises.
The skills that need more practice are definitely the complex queries involving subqueries, CTEs, and CASE statements. Tasks 18-20 were particularly challenging as they required combining multiple techniques. This assignment helped reinforce my understanding of how to organize and manipulate data effectively using SQL, especially when creating summary tables and pivot-style reports.

2. Problem-Solving Approach: Describe your approach to tackling the more complex tasks (like Tasks 18, 23, and 24). How did you break down these problems, and what steps did you take when you encountered challenges? How would you approach a similar problem differently in the future?

For the complex tasks, I approached them by breaking them down into smaller components. For Task 18, I first identified what information I needed (all possible region-income combinations and actual combinations), then created separate CTEs for each before combining them. When I encountered challenges with null values in comparisons, I had to add specific conditions to handle them correctly.
In the future, I would sketch out the data flow more carefully before writing queries for complex problems. I'd also create more test queries to verify intermediate results before combining everything into the final query.


3. Learning Takeaways: Consider the overall learning experience from this assignment. What were the biggest takeaways about working with SQL for data analysis and transformation? How do you think these skills will apply in real-world scenarios or future coursework?

The biggest takeaway from this assignment is how powerful SQL can be for data analysis beyond just data retrieval. I hadn't previously appreciated how techniques like CTEs and CASE statements could be used to create sophisticated reports directly in the database layer.
In real-world scenarios, these skills would be valuable for creating business intelligence dashboards and reports without having to export data to external tools. I can see how data analysts use these techniques to quickly answer business questions and identify patterns in large datasets, which would be applicable in future data analytics courses and professional roles.
